  "services.predictive.title": "Predictive Maintenance",
  "services.predictive.desc": "Every breakdown stop is an irrecoverable loss of time and resources. Using systems based on historical data and AI models, we anticipate failures before they occur, allowing technical interventions to be planned in advance. This reduces maintenance costs and prevents unexpected production interruptions.\n For example, in an industrial plant, the system can detect abnormal patterns in a motor's vibration or a pump's temperature, alerting the technical team before a serious failure happens.",

  "services.vision.title": "Computer Vision",
  "services.vision.desc": "Computer vision models inspect products with precision beyond human capability. Through deep neural networks, we detect microscopic defects or irregularities in production lines, ensuring consistent quality standards and reducing product rejection.\n This is especially useful in sectors such as pharmaceuticals or food processing, where automatic defect detection can prevent defective batches and improve product traceability.",

  "services.bots.title": "AI Bots and Assistants",
  "services.bots.desc": "We develop intelligent virtual assistants tailored to different needs: website or app integration, bots for internal information queries, or customer support.\n These systems automate repetitive tasks, provide instant responses, and enhance user experience. For example, a customer service bot can resolve common inquiries about orders or billing, while an internal assistant can help teams find documents or data instantly.",

  "services.analytics.desc": "We turn your company's data into a competitive advantage through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. We create models that forecast sales, optimize inventory management, segment customers, or define dynamic pricing.\n This enables better-informed decision-making and improves business efficiency. For example, a retailer can adjust promotions based on predicted demand, or a logistics company can optimize delivery routes.",
